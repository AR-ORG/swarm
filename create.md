Create a Swarm cluster

Initialize the cluster

We first create a swarm cluster which will be having multiple nodes. So in this demo , i have created 3 node manager node and 1 worker node

login to the one node, which you want to be as a manager node.

~$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
    192.168.99.100:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.


Increase work node

worker1:~$ docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex3nedyz0fb0xx14ie39trti4wxv-8vxv8rssmk743ojnwacrr2e7c \
    192.168.99.100:2377

This node joined a swarm as a worker

View cluster
After the top two steps, we already have a minimum Swarm cluster includes a management node and two working nodes.

Use the management node docker node lsview the cluster.

$ docker node ls
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
03g1y59jwfg7cf99w4lt0f662    worker2   Ready   Active

dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *  manager   Ready   Active        Leader
